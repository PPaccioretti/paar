# paar

The goal of paar is to …

## Installation

You can install the released version of paar from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("paar")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(paar)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
# Why should I use it?
# How do I use it?
# How do I get it?
# On GitHub, the README.md will be rendered as HTML and displayed on the repository home page.
# 
# I normally structure my README as follows:
# 
# A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.
# 
# An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.
# 
# Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.
# 
# An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub!
