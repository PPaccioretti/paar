The goal of paar is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of paar from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("paar")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(paar)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
# Why should I use it?
# How do I use it?
# How do I get it?
# On GitHub, the README.md will be rendered as HTML and displayed on the repository home page.
# 
# I normally structure my README as follows:
# 
# A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.
# 
# An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.
# 
# Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.
# 
# An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
