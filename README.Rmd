# On GitHub, the README.md will be rendered as HTML and displayed on the repository home page.
# 
# I normally structure my README as follows:
# 
# A paragraph that describes the high-level purpose of the package.
# 
# An example that shows how to use the package to solve a simple problem.
# 
# Installation instructions, giving code that can be copied and pasted into R.
# 
# An overview that describes the main components of the package. For more complex packages, this will point to vignettes for more details.
